Description: This package implements a multi-ancestry fine-mapping method based 
    on the "Multi-AnCestry Heritability INducEd Dirichlet decomposition" (MACHINE) 
    prior, as described in 
    https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajhg.2023.12.007.
    It is a novel multi-ancestry fine-mapping method that utilizes a continuous 
    global-local shrinkage prior.
    This method can be applied to both quantitative and binary traits.
    An MCMC algorithm is employed to obtain samples from the posterior 
    distribution.
    This method can also provide "credible sets" of candidate
    causal variants, which are generally provided by fine-mapping methods
    based on discrete-mixture priors.
